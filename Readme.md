In this repository the codes and raw data can be found for the Smart grids project that studies the effect of EV's in a cluster of thousand households.

In the directionary called 'device agents' one can find the agents that are made for this project. The agents are used in combination with the powermatcher software which can be found over here: https://github.com/flexiblepower/powermatcher

In the directionary called 'codes to create patterns' one can find the codes that were used to calculate and write the demand data into a text-file that was used by three agents to make bids.

In 'raw simulation data' one can find all the text files that were created during the different simulations. In this directionary one can also find a runnable python file to combine all these text files into one text file.

The data calculations that are done based on this raw data can be found in 'Data calculations'.

The used configurations for the clusters for the simulations can be found in 'JSON configurations'. 

Note: the used for software fore the simulations is not openly available.
